# Switter

> Tiny social network for snakes :snake:

You can visit demo on [heroku](https://switter-for-snakes.herokuapp.com/).

I built this app for fun and for practising and understanding relationships between Django models.

## In this app you can
- log in as one of the existing snake users (random selection)
- follow or unfollow other snakes
- write a sweet (like tweet on Twitter)

## Credit to Real Python
It's based on the tutorial [Build a Social Network With Django](https://realpython.com/django-social-network-1/).

I extended it by these fetaures:
- login random user
- translating human speech to snake hissing

## Built With
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Python web framework
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) - Front-end framework
